## Description

A generative webGL animation built with THREE.js which builds structures with sound. You can rotate the camera by clicking and dragging with the mouse and zoom in with the mouse wheel.

## Concept

The audio input spectrum controls the shape of the generated geometry. The geometry produced is inspired by the way nature builds structures. The animation demonstrates how a simple set of parameters can create complexity. To me Mike Gao's track is colourful and psychedelic and I tried to reflect this with my visualiser.
