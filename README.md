## Description

A generative webGL animation built with THREE.js which builds structures with sound

## Concept

The audio input spectrum controls the shape of the generated geometry. The geometry produced is inspired by the way nature builds structures. The animation demonstrates how a simple set of parameters can create complexity.

Although the app will react to any input sound, I tried to reflect the feel of Mike Gao's track through choice of colour and movement speed.
